# Welcome to Maha.xyz

MAHA (previously known as MahaDAO) is a community-powered decentralized organization. Our mission is to create a stablecoin that is deeply rooted into the Ether-sphere. With integrations towards LRTs, Lending Protocols and DeFi for growth.

At the heart of the ecosystem are two main tokens. MAHA and ZAI
